# School Projects

This is a repository that contains many of the code projects I worked on for university courses. 

## AI Block Sorting

A C++ program that reads the start and end states, analyzes and reorganize the blocks in as little moves as possible.<br>
[Jump to the code](<./AI-Block-Sorting>)

##  BlackJack

A simple single-player game of BlackJack, written in Racket.<br>
[Jump to the code](<./BlackJack>)

## Dictionary

Dictionary is a C++ trie that is used to store words in a dictionary, prompts the user to enter a word prefix, and displays all completions to user.<br>
[Jump to the code](<./BlackJack>)

## Gloomhaven Attack Simulator

This Python program simulates 1000 rounds (adjustable) to calculate the probability of each damage, effects average and the average attack damage to allow a user to optimize their deck configuration. The results are then plotted using matplotlib and seaborn.<br>
[Jump to the code](<./Gloomhaven-Attack-Simulator>)

## Hangman

A simple hangman game, written in Python.<br>
[Jump to the code](<./Hangman>)

## Organization Tree

Organization Tree is a C++ general tree that can store, manipulate, and query the organizational chart for a company.<br>
[Jump to the code](<./Hangman>)

## Recursive Racket

A few basic Racket functions operating recursively on lists and sets.<br>
[Jump to the code](<./Recursive-Racket>)

## Ruby Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree class with a few basic functions, written in Ruby.<br>
[Jump to the code](<./Ruby-BST>)

## Ruby Pair

Pair is a Racket class that mimics the cons box (a.k.a dotted pair) in Racket.<br>
[Jump to the code](<./Ruby-Pair>)

## Sequence

Sequence is a C++ class implemented as a doubly-linked list that supports random access like an array, but also allows dynamic insertion and removal of new elements like a list.<br>
